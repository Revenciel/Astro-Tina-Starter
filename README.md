# Tina + Astro Starter
## Work in progress

### Implemented:
- Visual editing
- Block-based editing
- Click-to-edit
- Search documents in edit mode
- Configurable nav links

### To do:
- make it so index cannot be deleted in the Tina editor
- implement blog
- - Make it possible to all list blog pages in a component
- build starter components
- build starter MDX components (buttons)
- Make ability to set favicon in site settings
- Improve UX for configurable nav links using templates (maybe - might be impossible)

### Thank you:
