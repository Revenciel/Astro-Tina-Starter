# Tina + Astro Starter
## Work in progress

### Implemented:
- Visual editing
- Block-based editing

### To do:
- make it so index cannot be deleted in the Tina editor
- Implement search
- Implement click-to-edit (maybe)
- implement blog
- build starter components
- build starter MDX components (buttons)

### Thank you:
